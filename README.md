# shmup
A simple space shooter written entirely in C using SDL2 and a small custom pre-processor. It's pretty much just a small project to test a slightly different game architecture from what I'm used to.

The code is pretty low quality but I'll probably try to clean it up as I go if I continue this project. 

Also I'm a complete noob at using GIT so this repo will probably get completely broken.
